To run these files and algorithms in Mac or Linux please follow following steps.
Step 1: download and install anaconda navigator latest version from this website https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/ 
Step 2: Run the anaconda navigator dashboard and select jupyter notebook
Step 3: Then install the necessary libraries which mention header part of each files and algorithms
Type these commnds in the anaconda powershell
$ python -m pip install <package> and 
$ pip install <package>
Step 4 : Run the files and algorithms.
Note: I have simulated these algorithms on kaggle paltform. Therefore input path in the coding will be based on the kaggle path. When you run the algorithm please modify those path according to your datasets stored.
